# Wikipedia: Most materials have Poisson's ratio values ranging between 0.0 and 0.5. For soft materials,[1] such as rubber, where the bulk modulus is much higher than the shear modulus, Poisson's ratio is near 0.5.
# Looking at this paper "ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF COTTON FABRIC BASED POLYMER COMPOSITIES"
# and this one "Modeling and analysis of the effect of substrate on the flexible piezoelectric films for kinetic energy harvesting from textiles"
# The ratio falls within 0.35-0.5
